First, initialize the backend with React.js and Express:
1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
2. Run npm init and set up the package.json file.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: npm install express cors mongoose
4. Create a server file (e.g. server.js) and set up a basic Express server.
5. Set up a .env file to store environment variables (including your MongoDB connection string).
6. Makefile: MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority.
7. Replace username, password, cluster, and database-name with your actual MongoDB connection details.
8. Next, create the necessary models (e.g. models/recipe.model.js).
9. Set up the routes for your API (e.g. routes/recipe.routes.js).
10. Create the frontend with React:
11. Use create-react-app to bootstrap your React app.
12. Set up the necessary components, such as RecipeList, RecipeItem, and AddRecipeForm.
13. Set up Axios to handle API requests.
14. Use your Axios instance to make API requests in your React components.
